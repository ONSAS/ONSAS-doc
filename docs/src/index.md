## What is ONSAS?

[ONSAS](https://github.com/ONSAS/ONSAS.m) is a toolkit with implementations of different numerical methods for static/dynamic and linear/non-linear analysis of structures. The first version was developed for educational purposes and published in a Structural Analysis [handbook](https://www.colibri.udelar.edu.uy/jspui/bitstream/20.500.12008/22106/1/Bazzano_P%c3%a9rezZerpa_Introducci%c3%b3n_al_An%c3%a1lisis_No_Lineal_de_Estructuras_2017.pdf). Currently different implementations and tools aimed for diverse applications are under development.


ONSAS is an Open Nonlinear Structural Analysis Solver.
