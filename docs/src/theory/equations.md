## equations

ONSAS is developed to solve the set of nonlynear equations given by the Principle of Virtual Displacements (PVD) and the Principle of Virtual Temperatures (PVT). The PVD equations are:

```math
\left(
     \mathbf{f}_{mas}(\mathbf{u}_t, \dot{\mathbf{u}}_t, \ddot{\mathbf{u}}_t) 
  +  \mathbf{f}_{vis}(\dot{\mathbf{u}}_t) 
  +  \mathbf{f}_{int}(\mathbf{u}_t)
\right) \cdot \delta \mathbf{w} 
=
0 \qquad \forall \delta \mathbf{w} \in \mathcal{V}
```
