# Linear Elastic Solid

In this tutorial we consider a linear elastic solid submitted to uniaxial loading.
The geometry given by $L_x$, $L_y$ and $L_z$, and a tension $p$ is applied on
the face at $x=L_x$, see the diagram below.

    Continue the tutorial as in the [User Guide](https://www.fing.edu.uy/~jorgepz/onsas/mainUserGuide.html).

We begin by defining the structural properties of the mesh.

The material properties of the model are defined by the MELCS parameters. In this case a SVK material is considered.

This model can be solved analytically and the result shows a good match between
the analytic result and the numerical solution obtained with ONSAS.
